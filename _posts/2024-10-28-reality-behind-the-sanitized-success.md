# The Reality Behind the Sanitized Versions of Success

## The Hidden Costs Behind Resilience

I’ve been working hard for as long as I can remember, only to find myself buried two, sometimes three, paychecks deep. By the time money hits my account, it’s already spent—swallowed up by bills, medical payments, and the demands of life that never seem to ease. It's like running a marathon with weights tied to my ankles, every step forward costing more than the last. But I keep running.

In a world that measures worth in dollars and social status, what does it mean to have nothing left after decades of giving everything? What does it mean when your achievements are overshadowed by setbacks that feel almost too personal to share? Failed relationships, financial struggles, health battles—they leave marks that don’t fade, scars that sometimes feel like they’re all people see. It’s exhausting to be weighed down by burdens I didn’t choose and still judged as if my value depends on what I have left to show.

A debt collector once asked me if I thought my health was more important than an ancient debt, one with no records, no history—just a demand from a faceless system. I told him what I’ll tell anyone who doubts: my life matters more than any ledger. Almost dying, fighting to survive health crises, confronting debt—these things shouldn’t define me, but here they are, etched into my story, each a reminder of a system that seems designed to keep people like me in place.

There are words people don’t often associate with the struggle I face—*disabilities,* for one. ADHD, depression, PTSD—these aren’t just words, they’re realities that make every step heavier, every day harder. These are invisible burdens, but they shape everything. They’re not excuses; they’re explanations. I’ve fought to understand and navigate these challenges, only to be told by society that they are weaknesses. But I see them differently now. These “disabilities” aren’t barriers—they’re part of my resilience, pieces of the puzzle that make me who I am.

I wonder sometimes if the world is ready to see the reality behind the sanitized versions of success and struggle we’re so often fed. Because here’s my reality: I am both the fighter and the fatigued, the person trying to get ahead and the one just trying to stay afloat. I’ve spent years finding ways to manage the intersections of my life—working through programs, searching for financial literacy that makes sense for someone like me, who’s dealing not just with money but with health crises and mental hurdles.

In a society that’s quick to box people in, I refuse to be boxed. I am reclaiming my story, my worth, on my terms. I am not the sum of my hardships or the weight of my debt. I am the resilience that pushes me forward, the creativity that allows me to survive, and the strength that keeps me from being silenced.

This blog is a small part of that journey—a space to put down the pieces of my story, not as a plea for sympathy but as a declaration of self-worth. This isn’t about perfection; it’s about honesty. Because I believe that there is value in every step of my story, in every battle fought, even if the world doesn’t always see it. And if you’re here, reading this, maybe you feel the same. We’re worth more than our struggles. We’re worth the story we choose to tell.
