# Life, Unedited

This blog is my so-what to the world—my chance to tell my story, my way. My life, much like anyone else's, isn’t a clean, tidy package of accomplishments and accolades. It’s complex, tangled, real. And I’m done with the world trying to compartmentalize me based on what they see on a screen. My story includes the reality of ADHD, depression, the burdens of racial bias, even the invisible marks left by trauma and survival. And each piece, every moment, deserves to be told.

I’ve spent years fighting to make my voice heard, even as society tries to define me by labels and assumptions. Here, I claim **my** space. A space where I get to speak authentically about what I’ve faced and how I’ve survived it. I’m here to shine a light on the grit that it takes to push through ADHD, mental health struggles, addiction, and yes, on the ways these experiences shape my work as a scientist and consultant. I'm sharing both the beautiful and the brutal—the "diamond" that hardship and hard work have made.

So, here’s my story in my voice: unedited, raw, eloquent, maybe messy, but mine. This is my place to connect the threads of my life, from work to the personal battles. Maybe you'll see pieces of yourself here too. Because we're all here, pushing against the rope, climbing, surviving, rising. I’m flipping the script, and I’m glad you’re here to read it.

Let's dig in... who wants to go first?
